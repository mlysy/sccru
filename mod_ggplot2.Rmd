## Introduction

In this tutorial, we assume that you have a basic understanding of R and RStudio. If not, check out the Chapter [Introduction to R][Introduction to R] for introductory basics on R and RStudio.

`r cran_link("ggplot2")` is a data visualization package for R and RStudio. It is implemented based on @wilkinson12. You can install and load the package using the command
```{r visgg-load, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
require("ggplot2")
```

The layers of a graph is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:visgg-grammar). Throughout this tutorial, we will show you how to build a plot layer by layer. 
```{r visgg-grammar, fig.cap="The layers of a graph", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visgg-grammarOfGraphics.png")
```

### Example Data Set

The examples shown in this tutorial use the data set `diamond` from the **ggplot2** package.

```{r visgg-data-load, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
data("diamonds")
```

The `diamond` data set consists of the price, quality information and physical measurements of different diamonds:

- carat,
- cut,
- colour,
- clarity,
- depth,
- table,
- x,
- y, and
- z.

You can see the structure of the data set using the function `str()`.
```{r visgg-data-str, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
str(diamonds)
```

The `diamond` data set consists of many data points. To simplify illustration of the different components in `ggplot2`, we will only use a subset of the data. To sample a subset:
```{r visgg-data-sample, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
set.seed(2019)
my.diamonds <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 100), ]
```
The function `set.seed()` ensures that the sample is consistent and replicable. 

## Data

The first step to graphing is to specify the data set and decide what goes on the axes. 

*Example:* Suppose we want to investigate how the price of a diamond behaves with respect to its carat. The two variables (or columns) involved are `price` and `carat`. The x-axis is usually the explanatory variable and the y-axis is the dependent (or response variable). In this scenario, `price` should be on the y-axis and `carat` on the x-axis. 

To initiate this graph in **ggplot2**, we have
```{r visgg-plot-blank, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

The function creates a blank plot with no points or lines in it. The function does not assume the type of graphs it needs to produce unless it was told. Since this is the first (base) layer which will be used over and over again, it is wiser to save it as an object
```{r visgg-plot-blank-save, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p <- ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

## Aesthetics

The first layer to be added on to the blank plot is a layer of the data points. In our case, we are interested to make a scatterplot. To add the layer of data points, we add `geom_point()` to the initial layer:
```{r visgg-aes-point, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_point()
```

Each layer has its own components. For this layer, the common components include:

- `col`: color of the points specified using names, rgb specification or NA for transparent color, 
- `size`: size of the points specified in millimeters, and
- `shape`: shape of the points.

### The Colour Component

A common way to specify the color of the points is through the name of the colors. For example, `red`, `darkblue`, `magenta`, `chocolate` etc.

A complete list of colors can be found [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).

For example, if we want the points to be blue, use
```{r visgg-aes-point-blue, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_point(col = "darkblue")
```

When `col=NA`, the points become transparent
```{r visgg-plot-point-NA, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA, warning=FALSE}
p + geom_point(col = NA)
```

#### Setting vs Mapping

So far, we **set** the color of the points to a specific color of our choice. In some cases, we prefer the color to change based on the information from another column (usually categorical) in the data set.

For example, suppose we want the color of the points on the graph to change based on `cut`, which has 5 categories: `Fair`, `Good`, `Very Good`, `Premium` and `Ideal`. 

```{r visgg-aes-col-cut, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_point(aes(col = cut))
```

This is called **mapping**.

#### Changing the Colour Palette

The choice of colors used in `aes()` is set through the choice of the color palette. When the choice is not mentioned, the default option is used. There are many online packages with pre-set palettes that you can use. We will show you the most common one: `ColorBrewer`.

For example, this is the "Set 1" colors from `ColorBrewer`.
```{r visgg-colbrew-set1, fig.cap="Set 1 from ColorBrewer", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visgg-colours-set1.png")
```
We can then use this set to color our points in the scatter plot.
```{r visgg-colbrew-set1-plot, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p1 <- p + geom_point(aes(col = cut))
p1 + scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

The `ColorBrewer` palettes come in three sub-groups:

- qualitative,
- sequential, and
- diverging.

All of them can be found [here](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/colorbrewer/). 

Our preference for general purposes is to use a color-blind friendly palette such as:

```{r visgg-colblind-grey, fig.cap="Colour blind friendly palette (grey)", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visgg-cbPalette-grey.png")
```

```{r visgg-colblind-black, fig.cap="Colour blind friendly palette (black)", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visgg-cbPalette.png")
```

Both palettes are not part of `ColorBrewer` and are extracted from [here](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/). They are coded as follow: 
```{r visgg-colblind-extract, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
# Color blind friendly palette with grey
cbgPalette <- c(
  "#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",
  "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7"
)
# Color blind friendly palette with black
cbbPalette <- c(
  "#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",
  "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7"
)
```

If you chose to create your own palette, we recommend to have them included at the very top of your R script to so you can use them throughout your project. 

Come back to our example, if we use the color bind friendly palette with grey, then we have
```{r visgg-colblind-grey-plot, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p1 + scale_colour_manual(values = cbgPalette)
```
If we use the color bind friendly palette with black, then the plot looks like the below.
```{r visgg-colblind-black-plot, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p1 + scale_colour_manual(values = cbbPalette)
```

### The Size Component

Another component of `geom_point()` is the size of the points. They can be changed by either setting or mapping. The size of the points is specified in millimeters. 

#### Setting the Size 

We can set the size of all the points in the plot to 5mm as below.
```{r visgg-aes-size-set, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p1 + geom_point(size = 5)
```

Here, we notice that
- All the points are larger in size.
- The color of the points are the same. Recall a few slides earlier, we however mapped the color of the points to `cut` and saved it.
    ```{r visgg-aes-col-save, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p1 <- p + geom_point(aes(col = cut))
    ```
When `geom_point()` was called the second time, it overwrites the command to map the color of the points.

So to change the color and size at the same time, we can use
```{r visgg-aes-col-size, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_point(aes(col = cut), size = 5)
```

#### Mapping the Size

Similar to mapping the color component, the size of the points can be mapped to a variable. 
```{r visgg-aes-size-map, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p1 + geom_point(aes(size = cut))
```

Notice in the previous graph that the points are in black color but the legend still includes `cut`. This is because we wrote:
```{r visgg-aes-size-exp1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, comment = NA}
p1 + geom_point(aes(size = cut))
```
However, due to our previously stored graph done:
```{r visgg-aes-size-exp2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, comment = NA}
p1 <- p + geom_point(aes(col = cut))
```
the plot appears "incorrect" and there will be a lot of warnings.

To map both color and size, we do this:
```{r visgg-aes-col-size-map, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_point(aes(col = cut, size = cut))
```

### The Shape Component

Another component to consider is the shape of the points, which are identified using numbers.

```{r visgg-aes-shape-list, fig.cap="Shapes", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visgg-ggplot2-shape-identity.png")
```

For example, we can set the shapes of the points to an inverse triangle. 
```{r visgg-aes-shape-invtri, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_point(shape = 6)
```

If we want to map the points to the `cut` of the diamonds, we can write
```{r visgg-aes-shape-cut, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA, warning=FALSE}
p + geom_point(aes(shape = cut), size = 5)
```

You may have received a warning that the shape component is not recommended for ordinal variable such as `cut`. This is a recommendation. Usually, shape is for nominal variable, i.e. categorical variables that do not have a natural ordering.

### A Brief Summary

- There are three basic components in `geom_point()`: color, size and shape.
- For each component, we can choose to set the points to our preference or map them to a variable.
- It is recommended to include how you want the points to look in one call of `geom_point()`. For example, 
    ```{r visgg-aes-summary, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, comment = NA, warning=FALSE}
p + geom_point(aes(col = cut, size = cut, shape = cut))
    ```

## Geometrics

Geometric objects perform the actual rendering of the layer and control the type of plot that you created. For example, 

- `geom_point()` produces scatterplots,
- `geom_line()` produces line graphs, and
- `geom_bar()` produces bar plots. 


### Line Graphs

Recall that 
```{r visgg-geo-recall, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, comment = NA}
p <- ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
```
Previously we have been drawing scatterplots to draw relationship between `carat` and `price`. We used `geom_point()`. What happens if we used `geom_line()`? 
```{r visgg-geo-line-plain, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line()
```

#### Setting Colour

```{r visgg-geo-line-col, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line(col = "red")
```

#### Setting the Thickness of the Line

```{r visgg-geo-line-size, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line(size = 1.5)
```

#### Setting the Type of the Line

```{r visgg-geo-line-type, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line(linetype = "dashed")
```

#### Lines with Points

```{r visgg-geo-line-points, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line() + geom_point()
```

#### Multiple Lines

To draw multiple lines, the points must be grouped by a variable. Otherwise, all the points will be connected by a single line. 

Suppose we are interested to draw the lines according to `cut`. Hint: The base layer needs to incorporate the `group` of the points. 
```{r visgg-geo-lines-plain, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p2 <- ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, group = cut))
p2 + geom_line()
```

We can adjust the color by the `group`.
```{r visgg-geo-lines-col, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, group = cut)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = cut))
```
To map the colors of the lines to `cut`, there are two options:

- Option 1:
    ```{r visgg-geo-lines-col1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, comment = NA}
ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, group = cut)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = cut))
    ```
- Option 2:
    ```{r visgg-geo-lines-col2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, comment = NA}
ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(
  x = carat, y = price, group = cut,
  col = cut
)) +
  geom_line()
    ```

To demonstrate the benefit of using the second option, we will use a simulated data set that contains nominal variables.
```{r visgg-data-fake, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE , comment = NA}
dat1 <- data.frame(
  sex = factor(c("Female", "Female", "Male", "Male")),
  time = factor(c("Lunch", "Dinner", "Lunch", "Dinner"),
    levels = c("Lunch", "Dinner")
  ),
  total_bill = c(12.53, 17.8, 15.24, 17.2)
)

dat1
```

Suppose we are interested to visualize the relationship between `time` (nominal) and `total_bill` (continuous) while considering the effect of `sex` (nominal) using both lines and points.

- Option 1
    ```{r visgg-data-fake1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
ggplot(dat1, aes(x = time, y = total_bill, group = sex)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = sex)) +
  geom_point(aes(col = sex))
    ```

- Option 2
    ```{r visgg-data-fake2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
ggplot(dat1, aes(
  x = time, y = total_bill, group = sex,
  col = sex
)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
    ```

Option 2 is more efficient than Option 1. You can manipulate the components of the line and points as shown earlier. 

### Bar Plots

Bar plots are commonly used to graph categorical variables. 

For example, the total price of diamonds by `cut` or `colour`.
```{r visgg-geo-bar-plain, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = color, y = price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
Notice that the x- and y-axes are similar to that of the scatterplots. The only difference is the use of `geom_bar()`. 

Suppose we want to add fill colors
```{r visgg-geo-bar-col, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
ggplot(my.diamonds, aes(x = color, y = price, fill = color)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

## Others

Some items of interest to all:

- x- and y-axes labels,
- title of the graph, and
- legends.

### Axes Labels

Similar to the base R, we can change the labels of the axes by adding the components as follow:

- x-axis: `xlab("name")`
- y-axis: `ylab("name")`

```{r visgg-lables, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line(col = "red") +
  xlab("Price") + ylab("Carat")
```

### Title of the Graph

To add a title to the graph, we can use `ggtitle()`

```{r visgg-title, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line(col = "red") +
  xlab("Price") + ylab("Carat") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between price and carat")
```

The title are left-centered and can be adjusted through the "theme" layer which we will not covered here. The title is usually not useful since we will add caption to the graphs when writing up the results. 

### Legends

There are two ways for changing the legends title and labels:

- modify the data frame directly, or
- use `scale_xxx_yyy()`. Refer [here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Legends_(ggplot2)/) for the different combinations of `xxx` and `yyy`.

Suppose we want the legend to show the `cut` in different colors. Since the legend is related to the color of the lines, `xxx` is `colour` and the variable is categorical, we set `yyy` to `discrete`:
```{r visgg-legend, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = NA}
p + geom_line(aes(col = cut)) +
  scale_colour_discrete(
    name = "Cut of diamonds",
    breaks = c("Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Premium", "Ideal"),
    labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
  )
```
